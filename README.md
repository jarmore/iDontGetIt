Welcome to the idontgetit readme! 

This will be a, as I develop it, recollection of the Xamarin.Android application I'm making in Mobile Computing.

This application was developed using Visual Studio and will therefore be required to compile. You can use either the Emulator inside the Android SDK, or a local device. 

To run the application you will need to add the Mono.Data.SQLite.dll to the list of references to run the application and download the nuget package SQLite by Frank Kruegor - please follow this video at about 13 minutes if you have any issues.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAw0Fa92qNE
